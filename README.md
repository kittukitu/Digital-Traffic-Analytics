Website Traffic Forecasting and Marketing Insights
This project generates synthetic daily website traffic data with behavioral metrics and applies Holt-Winters exponential smoothing to forecast future sessions. It incorporates user inputs to tailor forecasts based on marketing campaign intensity and provides actionable marketing recommendations along with relevant visualizations.

Features
Synthetic website traffic data simulated over two years with:

Daily sessions incorporating weekly and yearly seasonality,

Average session duration, bounce rate, and conversion rate metrics.

User-specified forecast start date and forecast horizon.

Adjustment of traffic based on marketing campaign intensity (0 to 2 scale).

Time series forecasting of sessions using Holt-Winters exponential smoothing with weekly seasonality.

Marketing recommendations based on forecasted average traffic volume.

Visualizations include:

Historical and forecasted website sessions,

Behavioral metrics trends over time (session duration, bounce rate, conversion rate).

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

statsmodels

Install dependencies via:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
Usage
Run the script
A synthetic dataset synthetic_website_traffic.csv will be created containing simulated sessions and behavioral metrics.

User Inputs

Enter forecast start date in YYYY-MM-DD format within the dataset range.

Enter the number of days to forecast (positive integer).

Enter marketing campaign intensity on a scale from 0 (no campaign) to 2 (double intensity), where 1 means normal intensity.

Outputs

Tabular forecast of daily website sessions for the specified horizon.

Marketing recommendations based on forecast traffic levels:

High traffic: Increase ad spend and server capacity.

Moderate traffic: Maintain current budget and monitor peaks.

Low traffic: Consider campaigns to boost traffic.

Plots visualizing:

Historical and forecasted sessions,

Behavioral metrics trends: average session duration, bounce rate, and conversion rate.

Files
synthetic_website_traffic.csv: Generated synthetic website traffic dataset.

Python script: Generates data, accepts user input, runs forecast, and generates recommendations and visualizations.

Notes
Traffic adjustment by marketing intensity applies from forecast start date onward.

Weekly seasonality is used in forecasting due to typical web traffic patterns.

Visualizations require a graphical environment.
